## Typerun. Resumen
Hello  and welcome to **Typerun**, a time-against minigame where you have to type a word for each letter of the alphabet.
You have 20 seconds type each word, once the time passes they game will move on to the next letter, and if you didn't type
any word then the word for the letter of the moment will be "Unanswered". Once you finish the game it will show the total 
time taken for this little test and the time taken of each word you introduced and its definitions.
